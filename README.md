A simple Weather App Copy Cat made in SwiftUI to demonstrate the usage of Weather Kit.

Specifically, this app is able to fetch and display the following 
- Current Weather
- Hourly forecast
- Daily forecast

In addition, the app will also automatically update weather data based on the data expiration date/time.
